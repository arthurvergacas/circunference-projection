<h1>Circunference projection on any given axis</h1>

<p>This project was made using <a href = "https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and was inspired by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snHKEpCv0Hk">this Numberphile video</a>.</p>
<p>It works by taking a single point moving in a circunference path, and then project it orthogonally on to any given axis.</p>
<p>For simplicity, as well as fanciness, the axis are always equaly separated and relative to the X axis <em>(PI radians)</em>. However, feel fre to use this algorithm for any orthogonal projection</p>
